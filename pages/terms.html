                <li><b>Contest Participation</b><br />
                    CricBrawl may offer contests / brawls, tournaments, or other interactive features ("Contests") on
                    the
                    Platform.
                    Participation in Contests is subject to additional terms and conditions, which will be made
                    available to you
                    at the time
                    of participation. By participating in Contests, you agree to abide by the rules and guidelines set
                    forth by
                    CricBrawl.
                    Availability: Contests may vary in type, format, duration, and entry requirements. CricBrawl
                    reserves the
                    right to
                    introduce, modify, or discontinue Contests at any time without prior notice.
                    Entry Fees: Certain Contests may have entry fees associated with them, which must be paid by users
                    to
                    participate. The
                    amount of the entry fee, if applicable, will be specified in the Contest rules. By entering a
                    Contest with
                    an entry fee,
                    users agree to pay the required amount.
                    Fair Play: CricBrawl is committed to maintaining the integrity of its Contests and ensuring fair
                    play among
                    participants. Any attempts to manipulate or exploit the Contest system, including but not limited to
                    cheating,
                    collusion, or use of automated scripts, are strictly prohibited and may result in disqualification
                    from the
                    Contest and
                    suspension of the user's account.
                    Publicity: By participating in Contests, users grant CricBrawl the right to use their name,
                    likeness, and
                    other personal
                    information for promotional purposes, including but not limited to announcing winners and displaying
                    user
                    profiles on
                    the Platform.</li>
                <li><b>Eligibility for Contests</b><br />
                    To participate in contests offered by CricBrawl, users must meet certain eligibility criteria,
                    including but
                    not limited
                    to age and jurisdiction. In addition to providing accurate personal information during registration,
                    users
                    may be
                    required to upload a valid form of identification (ID) to verify their age and jurisdiction. This ID
                    verification
                    process helps ensure compliance with the legal requirements of the jurisdictions in which CricBrawl
                    operates.</li>
                <li><b>Fantasy Sports Contests</b><br />
                    Contests offered by CricBrawl are classified as fantasy sports games, which are based on skill and
                    require
                    users to
                    demonstrate their cricket knowledge to win prizes. However, it is important to note that the
                    legality of
                    fantasy sports
                    contests varies by jurisdiction. While fantasy sports are recognized as games of skill in many
                    states and
                    jurisdictions,
                    some states have specific regulations or prohibitions regarding the operation of fantasy sports
                    contests.
                    Jurisdiction Verification: As part of the registration process, users may be required to upload a
                    valid form
                    of
                    identification (ID), such as a driver's license or passport, to verify their jurisdiction of
                    residence. This
                    ID
                    verification helps ensure that users are eligible to participate in fantasy sports contests based on
                    the
                    laws and
                    regulations of their respective jurisdictions. Users residing in jurisdictions where fantasy sports
                    contests
                    are
                    prohibited or restricted may be ineligible to participate in certain contests offered by CricBrawl.
                    These
                    users will
                    still be able to use the platform features for a set platform fee.
                    Compliance with Applicable Laws: CricBrawl is committed to complying with all applicable laws and
                    regulations governing
                    the operation of fantasy sports contests. Users are responsible for familiarizing themselves with
                    the laws
                    and
                    regulations of their jurisdiction regarding the legality of participating in fantasy sports
                    contests. By
                    registering for
                    an account and participating in contests on the Platform, users represent and warrant that they are
                    eligible
                    to do so
                    under the laws of their jurisdiction.</li>
                <li><b>Prize Distribution</b><br />
                    Prizes for contests will be awarded to winners as specified in the contest rules. CricBrawl reserves
                    the
                    right to cancel
                    or modify contests at its discretion. Prize winnings will be deposited into the user's Account upon
                    verification of
                    eligibility.</li>
                <li><b>Disqualification and Cancellation</b><br />
                    CricBrawl reserves the right to disqualify users from contests and suspend or terminate their
                    Accounts for
                    engaging in
                    fraudulent, improper, or unfair conduct. Contest cancellations may occur in certain circumstances to
                    ensure
                    the
                    integrity of the platform.</li>
                <li><b>Limitation of Liability</b><br />
