                advertising partners to
                display advertisements. These third-party websites and services have their own privacy policies, and we
                are not
                responsible for their practices. Users should review the privacy policies of these third parties before
                providing any

            </p>

            <h5>Data Security</h5>
            <p>CricBrawl employs physical, electronic, and managerial measures to protect the confidentiality,
                integrity, and security
                of user information. We use encryption, firewalls, access controls, and other security technologies to
                safeguard user
                data against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>

            <h5>Account Deletion</h5>
            <p>You have the right to request the deletion of your account and associated personal data from our system.
                Upon receiving
                such a request, we will permanently delete your account and all personal information associated with it,
                except where
                retention is necessary for compliance with legal obligations, resolving disputes, or enforcing our
                agreements.</p>

            <p>Please note that deleting your account may not necessarily remove all content or information that you
                have provided to
                us, as some data may be retained in backups or archives for a certain period of time. However, such data
                will be
                securely isolated and will not be accessible except as required by law.</p>

            <h5>Children's Privacy</h5>
            <p>Our Platform is not intended for children under the age of 18, and we do not knowingly collect personal
                information from
                children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal
                information, please
                contact us to request deletion of the information.
            </p>

            <h5>Access from Outside the US</h5>
            <p>While our services are primarily intended for users in the United States, personal and non-personal data
                may be
                transferred to, stored in, and processed in other countries where our service providers are located. By
                using our
                services, you consent to the transfer and processing of your information as described in this Privacy
                Policy.</p>

            <h5>Tax and Regulatory Filing</h5>
            <p>In certain circumstances, such as when users withdraw funds or have winnings in excess of required
                thresholds, we may
                require users to provide additional information, including social security numbers, for identity
                verification and tax
                purposes. We handle this information in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. </p>
